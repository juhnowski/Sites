The sensor measures up to 10 amps AC on a wire that passes through its window. Connects to an analog input.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The i-Snail-VC is a self powered AC current transducer that provides a 0-5V dc analog signal proportional to the AC current flowing through the device wire window (sine wave RMS calibrated).
The i-Snail-VC is ideal for load monitoring without the need for an external power supply. Factory calibrated, fixed ranges ensure superior accuracy and eliminate configuration and adjustments in the field, saving time and avoiding confusion. Color coded labels allow for easy identification of full scale range.
The 13.7mm (0.54") wire window accommodates a conductor up to AWG #2. Multiple turns of the primary wire may be used to alter the input range. Output voltage is clamped at 6.5V, and the unit delivers a linear output up to 120% overload (6V).

The i-Snail-S closes an electrical switch when currents greater than 0.15A are detected in the wire that passes through its window.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The i-Snail-S switch provides an accurate and cost effective method of monitoring the on/off status of electric loads including fans, pumps, motors, heaters and virtually any AC powered device.
The i-Snail-S serves as an ultra sensitive Go/No-Go load sensor. The dry contact relay (N.O.) closes when a minimum amount (150mA) of AC current is flowing through its monitored line. The device is ideal for monitoring the running state of fans, motors, pumps, heaters or any device that is AC powered, including large and small loads.
The output is a bi-directional solid state relay with a low turn on resistance of less than 4 ohms. The output may be interfaced to PLCs, DDC panels or other relays. The advanced hysteresis and transient detection circuitry prevent chattering and false switching due to line spikes and transients.
The i-Snail-S features a rugged enclosure with integrated barrier strip terminal block for easy wiring in the field.
Note: The i-Snail Current Status Switch measures the current in a single AC wire (either the positive or the negative). If you put the whole cable through the window the + and - wires will cancel each other out and the sensor will read a null current value.

This sensor measures up to 10mA DC and connects to an analog input.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
This DC Current sensor measures DC current, up to 10mA. Powered by an external 12VDC power supply, the DC Current Sensor provides a 0 to 5VDC analog signal that is linearly proportional to the current measured at the terminal blocks.
The DC Current Sensor can easily be mounted using the screw holes, or on a 35mm wide DIN rail for quick installation. The terminal blocks accommodate conductors of up to AWG #16.
In order to measure the current, the sensor has an internal 50 Ohm resistor. This will result in a slight voltage drop before the voltage gets to the device requiring the power. Consequently, the “leftover” voltage might not be high enough to power the device, especially if the power supply has a voltage close to the device’s minimum voltage requirements. As a point of comparison, using a 9V battery running through an LED with a forward voltage of 1.8V and a 1000 Ohm resistor, there is an approximate drop of 0.35V due to the 50 Ohm sensing resistor on the 10mA DC Current Sensor. The maximum voltage drop is 0.5V, when the sensor is measuring 10mA.
The output of this sensor is not clamped at 5V. If the current being measured exceeds the rated input current, more than 5V will appear at the output signal. This can damage the Phidget Board (or any other ADC) that it is attached to if the output signal exceeds 5V for an extended period of time.
The current sensor connects to an analog input on Phidgets I/O boards.<br> The formula to translate the SensorValue into Current is:<br>
I(mA) = SensorValue * 0.01

This bi-directional current transducer measures ±50 amps DC on a wire that passes through its window.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
This series of DC transducers are a set of hall-effect based sensors that can measure the amount of current flowing through a wire simply by threading the wire through the sensor's window. You can thread the same wire through multiple times and divide the result by the number of times it's been threaded through in order to achieve higher resolution. This sensor can measure Current in either direction; from -50 to 50 Amps. A bi-directional current sensor is ideal for applications when the direction of the current is not guaranteed to always flow the same way- for example, you could measure the current output of a battery, and also monitor the current consumed by the battery when it is charging. You can convert from SensorValue with the following formula (SensorValue is equal to the return voltage of the sensor multiplied by 200): 

<br>Current (A) = (SensorValue * 0.1) - 50 <br>

This sensor requires a ±12V power supply. You can use the 5V to ±12V Sensor Adapter as a simple option to connect to a InterfaceKit.

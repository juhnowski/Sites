The Bridge is the interface board needed to measure the output from a load cell. You can connect up to four load cells, strain gauges, or wheatstone bridge sensors.
<br>

        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The Bridge lets you connect up to 4 un-amplified Wheatstone bridges, such as:
<ul>
<li>&nbsp - &nbsp strain gauges</li>
<li>&nbsp - &nbsp compression load cells</li>
<li>&nbsp - &nbsp pressure sensors/Barometers</li>
<li>&nbsp - &nbsp piezoresistive accelerometers</li>
<li>&nbsp - &nbsp Magnetoresistive sensors (Compasses)</li>
</ul>
The data rate and gain values can be configured in software.

This load cell measures compressive forces of up to 10 lbs and connects directly to an analog input.
<br>

        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The Sensor is a medium compression force sensor that offers excellent performance at a reasonable cost. The Sensor offers normalized zero and span for interchangeability and is thermally compensated for changes in zero and span with respect to temperature.
The Sensor can be used in applications such as Robotics End-Effectors, Variable Force Control, Load and Compression Sensing, Contact Sensing, and Weighing.
The Sensor incorporates MEAS’ proprietary Microfused™ technology which employs micromachined silicon piezoresistive strain gages fused with high temperature glass to a high performance stainless steel substrate. Microfused™ technology eliminates age-sensitive organic epoxies used in traditional load cell designs providing excellent long term span and zero stability.
The Sensor measures direct force and is therefore not subject to lead-die fatigue failure common with competitive designs which use a pressure capsule embedded within a silicone gel-filled cavity. Operating at very low strains, Microfused™ technology provides an essentially unlimited cycle life expectancy, superior resolution, and high over-range capabilities.

This load cell measures shear force up to 780g and connects to a bridge input.
<br>

        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
A load cell is a force sensing module - a carefully designed metal structure, with small elements called strain gauges mounted in precise locations on the structure. Load cells are designed to measure a specific force, and ignore other forces being applied. The electrical signal output by the load cell is very small and requires specialized amplification. Fortunately, the Bridge will perform all the amplification and measurement of the electrical output.
Load cells are designed to measure force in one direction. They will often measure force in other directions, but the sensor sensitivity will be different, since parts of the load cell operating under compression are now in tension, and vice versa.
This Single Point Load Cell is used in small jewelry scales and kitchen scales. It’s mounted by bolting down the end of the load cell where the wires are attached, and applying force on the other end in the direction of the arrow. Where the force is applied is not critical, as this load cell measures a shearing effect on the beam, not the bending of the beam. If you mount a small platform on the load cell, as would be done in a small scale, this load cell provides accurate readings regardless of the position of the load on the platform.

This S-type load cell measures compressive or tensile forces of up to 500kg and connects to a bridge input.

        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
A load cell is a force sensing module - a carefully designed metal structure, with small elements called strain gauges mounted in precise locations on the structure. Load cells are designed to measure a specific force, and ignore other forces being applied. The electrical signal output by the load cell is very small and requires specialized amplification. Fortunately, the Bridge will perform all the amplification and measurement of the electrical output.
This S-Type load cell can be operated in compression or tension.

        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
A load cell is a force sensing module - a carefully designed metal structure, with small elements called strain gauges mounted in precise locations on the structure. Load cells are designed to measure a specific type of force, and ignore other forces being applied. The electrical signal output by the load cell is very small and requires specialized amplification. Fortunately, the 1046 PhidgetBridge will perform all the amplification and measurement of the electrical output.
This Button Load Cell is used in heavy applications. The bottom of the load cell can be bolted to a surface, and force applied to the button on the top. By loading only the button, which is slightly rounded, the load cell is less sensitive to errors resulting from the load not pushing down exactly straight on the load cell.

        <p><a href="images/3142_0_Big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/3142_0.jpg" class="leftimg"></a>
        <strong class="color2">Product Features</strong><br>
Designed for steel structures, this strain gauge comes in the half-bridge shear configuration.
<br>

        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
A strain gauge is a small sensor whose resistance changes depending on the strain experienced by the structure it is attached to. They are similar to Load Cells, but are useful for applications where the structure has already been built. For example, you could use a strain gauge and a Bridge 4-Input to measure the strain on various segments of the chassis of a robot or vehicle.
For more information on the different types of strain gauges and how to properly install them, have a look at our Strain Gauge Primer.

This strain gauge is designed to be used with steel structures. It can be used with other materials, but using steel will result in the lowest sensitivity to changes in temperature. The double shear pattern makes it easy to mount for torsional strain measurement. 

This is a half-bridge strain gauge. You can either use two to form a full-bridge circuit, or use resistors with a half-bridge. For more information on bridge circuits, see the Strain Gauge Primer.

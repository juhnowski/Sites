This board has 4 SPDT mechanical relays rated at 250VAC/10A or 100VDC/5A.        
        <br><strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The PhidgetInterfaceKit 0/0/8 provides Small Signal Relays with 8 Relay Outputs, rated at 250VAC, or 2 Amps, for a maximum of 60 Watts. While typical mechanical relay boards are unable to switch signals due to an oxide buildup on the contacts, the 1017 excels at switching both signals and low-power applications.

Control 8 DPDT mechanical relays, switching up to 250VAC/2A or 200VDC/2A.        
        <br><strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The InterfaceKit 0/0/4 Provides a convenient way to interface your PC with various higher-voltage devices such as incandescent bulbs, high-power relays, and motors
This contains 4 Relay Outputs for switching AC or DC power; the relays are Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT).
Note: This board is not suitable for switching signals. It takes at least 100mA of current to bridge the oxide layer that forms on the relay contacts, and most signals will not meet this requirement. If you need to switch signals, check out the InterfaceKit 0/0/8.

Rated for 28VAC/2.5A or 40VDC/2.5A switching, this SSR is controlled by a digital output.     
        <br><strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
Solid State Relays, or SSRs, are devices designed to operate like standard relays but without mechanical motion. By simply providing a small voltage to the control side of the circuit, you can open or close a higher powered circuit on the load side.
The SSR Board is safe to use with sensitive control devices like microprocessors, and will not damage a Phidget device or your PC. Optoisolation between the control inputs and outputs of the SSR in the form of an LED paired with a set of optically-controlled MOSFETs provides protection from output to input. An on-board diode across the relay output protects the board from static electricity and surges from inductive loads.

        <strong class="color2">Product Features</strong><br>
Use this heatsink to run one SSR at full current switching capacity without overheating.
        <br><strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
Medium and high current (>5A) SSRs can generate a lot of heat during operation. Failure to manage the generation of heat by the SSR during switching may damage the SSR and lead to product failure. When using an SSR this problem of heat dissipation must be managed. It is very important to select an adequate heatsink if you plan on using your SSR at its maximum specifications. To assist with heat dissipation, a thermal pad (packaged with all "hockey puck" type SSRs we sell) should be used between the relay and the heatsink. For very high performance applications, air cooling may also be necessary.
This heatsink is designed to slide onto standard 35mm O-type DIN rail.

This SSR switches up to 120VDC / 25A and connects to any device with a digital output.
        <br><strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
If you need to switch DC power, this solid state relay is the perfect mix of quality and affordability. 
Using the digital outputs from a Phidgets device, you can control the relay to silently switch a DC circuit at 120V/25A or less. There's an indicator LED on the control side of the circuit so you can tell the state of the relay at a glance.
If your SSR is overheating, you should consider getting a heat sink for safety. Heat sinks small and large are compatible with this device. This SSR comes with a heat transfer pad that can be placed between the metal base of the SSR and the surface it's mounted to in order to help encourage heat flow. It also comes with a diode that can be used to protect your SSR against back EMF.

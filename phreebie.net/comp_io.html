        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The Analog 4-Output Produces a voltage over -10V to +10V. This voltage will be asserted up to +-20mA. An error will be reported when this current is exceeded, and the voltage the customer is getting is no longer accurate. The voltage is produced with 12 bit resolution (4.8mV).
The board is not isolated and all 4 channels share a common ground.
All the power is supplied by the USB bus.

        <strong class="color2">Product Features</strong><br>
The ideal product for OEMs and Systems Integrators. The small DIP-36 package will plug right into your own designed board.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
Provides the full functionality of the 8/8/8 I/O board in a small DIP-36 package that is plugged into your own board. If you want the 8/8/8 functionality but space is an issue, or you are building a number of units and want to eliminate wiring between boards, this is the way to go.
You can create a smaller system by integrating custom electronics into your PCB, and by only using connectors for the wiring required in your system. Eliminating or reducing wiring also helps create a much more reliable system.
The InterfaceKit allows you to connect devices to any of 8 analog inputs, 8 digital inputs and 8 digital outputs. It provides a generic, convenient way to interface your PC with various devices.

Small Dongle with 2 Analog Inputs, 2 Digital Inputs and 2 Digital Outputs. Use it when space is critical.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
Designed for customers who only need a couple of Analog Inputs, Digital Inputs or Digital Outputs, the dongle size PhidgetInterfaceKit 2/2/2 is ideal for projects where space is critical.
To keep the board small, we have removed the connectors from the board and brought them out through a 12-Wire cable.
<br><strong class="color3">Analog Inputs</strong><br>
The Analog Inputs are used to measure continuous quantities, such as temperature, humidity, position, pressure, etc. Phidgets offers a wide variety of sensors that can be plugged directly into the 1011's female cable connector using the cable included with the sensor.
Sampling rates can be set at 1ms, 2ms, 4ms, 8ms and multiple of 8ms up to 1000ms.
<br><strong class="color3">Digital Inputs</strong><br>
The Digital Inputs have a Digital Input Hardware Filter to eliminate false triggering from electrical noise. They can be used to convey the state of devices such as push buttons, limit switches, relays, and logic levels.
Digital Outputs
The Digital Outputs can be used to drive LEDs, solid state relays (such as the 3052 SSR Relay Board), transistors; in fact, anything that will accept a CMOS signal.

Use it to check the state of switches, push buttons, relays and/or to switch relays, solenoids, motors and even high power LEDs.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
<strong class="color3">Digital Inputs</strong><br>

The Digital Inputs are activated by an external voltage source, triggering on a wide voltage range - 4 to 30VDC. They provide built-in filtering, to eliminate false triggering from electrical noise. They can be used to convey the state of on/off devices, such as push buttons, limit switches, relays.

<br><strong class="color3">Digital Outputs</strong><br>

The Open Collector Digital Outputs can be used to directly control substantial devices, switching up to 30VDC at up to 2 Amps. The Output acts as a switch to ground, so the circuit you're switching will need an external power supply. Each output is protected from transient voltages typical when switching inductive devices - relays, solenoids, motors. The Outputs can be used to directly control devices requiring substantial power such as incandescent lights, high power LEDs, relays, solenoids, motors.

Measures the frequency of an analog or digital signal and power small devices like Hall Effect sensors, flow rate sensors, and tachometers.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The Frequency Counter is designed to count events from an analog signal over time and calculate a frequency from it. The product can count a logic level or signal centered around zero volts. Signals with a different ground can be counted, provided they are within the common mode range (+-10V).
The Frequency Counter can also power small devices, such as Hall Effect, flow rate sensors, tachometers, and other sensors.
The Frequency Counter contains two channels to sense two different inputs. Each channel has two different circuits to sense for logic level-frequencies or zero-centered frequencies. The measurable frequency is accurate to 0.25% up to 1MHz. The Frequency Counter may measure frequencies past 1 Mhz, but the input voltage specifications will not hold.
The Frequency Counter can measure frequencies down to ~ 0.01Hz. However the response time of these measurements is directly related to the frequency, thus it could take 1 or 2 periods(100-200s) to detect the input frequency.

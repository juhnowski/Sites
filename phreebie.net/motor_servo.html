        <strong class="color2">Product Features</strong><br>
For applications where a finite range of motion is not acceptable, use this continuous rotation servo.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The motor is a special motor manufactured to operate as a continuous rotation servo. Dual ball bearings on the output shaft ensure long lasting performance. Essentially, it is a gear motor that can be controlled by an RC servo controller. It is not normally used as an actuator, as there is no way of commanding it to move to a particular position, as a standard RC servo does.
Normal servos can be adapted to continuous rotation use, but the problem is that the range of positions that result in the motor being stopped is very narrow. Continuous rotation servos, depending on the position commanded, can go forward or reverse at different speeds. With an adapted continuous rotation servo, the position range for the different speeds is very narrow, making it difficult to produce a specific speed.
The 3202 is superior because it has a very wide "deadband" so you can be sure the motor is stopped when you command it, and the position range for forward or reverse motion is very wide, giving lots of speed resolution.

This powerful continuous rotation servo has 12 kg·cm of torque, making it a versatile choice.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The motor is a standard servo that has been built by SpringRC specifically for continuous rotation (up to 60 RPM at 4.8 V), and it produces a lot of torque (13 kg-cm at 4.8 V). It features two ball bearings on the output shaft for reduced friction, and it offers easy access to the rest-point adjustment potentiometer. Essentially, it is a gear motor that can be controlled by an RC servo controller. It is not normally used as an actuator, as there is no way of commanding it to move to a particular position, as a standard RC servo does.
The motor continuous rotation servo converts RC servo position pulses into continuous rotation speed. The default rest point is 1.5 ms, but this can be adjusted by using a small slotted screwdriver to turn the middle-point positioner (see the Mechanical Drawing). Pulse widths above the rest point result in counterclockwise rotation, with speed increasing as the pulse width increases; pulse widths below the rest point result in clockwise rotation, with speed increasing as the pulse width decreases.
Normal servos can be adapted to continuous rotation use, but the problem is that the range of positions that result in the motor being stopped or operating at less than maximum speed is very narrow. Continuous rotation servos, depending on the position commanded, can go forward or reverse at different speeds. With an adapted continuous rotation servo, the position range for the different speeds is very narrow, making it difficult to produce a specific speed.
These dedicated continuous rotation servos are superior because they have a very wide “deadband” so you can be sure the motor is stopped when you command it, and the position range for forward or reverse motion is very wide, giving lots of speed resolution.

This servo actuator has a stroke length of 100mm with a peak force of 23N and a peak speed of 12 mm/s.
<br>
        <strong class="color2">Product Description</strong><br>
The L12 Linear Actuator is an axial design with a powerful drivetrain and a rectangular cross section for increased rigidity.
The L12 actuator is designed to move push or pull loads along its full stroke length. The speed of travel is determined by the gearing of the actuator and the load or force the actuator is working against at a given point in time. When power is removed, the actuator stops moving and holds its position, unless the applied load exceeds the backdrive force, in which case the actuator will backdrive. Stalling the actuator under power for short periods of time (several seconds) will not damage the actuator.
The linear actuator is an alternative to designing with gears, motors, servos and linkages. The controller sees the actuator as a standard RC servo.
